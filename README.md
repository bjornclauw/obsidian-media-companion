# Media Companion Plugin for Obsidian

> [!CAUTION]
> This plugin creates and edits a file for each media file. Before using it on any vault, **make a backup**.

> [!WARNING]
> The file types this plugin is known to work for have been added in the default settings of the plugin.
> Other formats that Obsidian supports *may* work but they are **not** (yet) officially supported.

A companion plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that creates a gallery with all your media files. The plugin aims to let you search through these files. Additionally, it creates sidecar files for each media file, to allow for adding notes, tags, and so on.

## Features

Search through your files based on folders, tags, or file types.

More complex searching can also be done, like searching by color (**without** use of AI!). You can see the plugin in action [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBByEOAPmYc)

### Waterfall batch edit

In the waterfall Bases view (`mc-waterfall`) you can `Ctrl/Cmd`-click and `Shift`-click to multi-select cards. A sticky batch bar above the grid lets you pick a frontmatter property (autocomplete from visible columns, `X` to clear, `▾` to show all), choose an operation and enter a value:

- **Lists** (`tags`, any `ListValue` column): `Replace` (orange), `Append`/`Remove` (blue/red), `Fill empty`, `Clear` (red)
- **Scalars**: `Replace` (orange), `Fill empty`, `Clear` (red)

Values are deduped (`a, b`) and written via `processFrontMatter` (sidecar created if missing, `MC-*` reserved). A confirmation modal previews the operation, value (`#tag` for tags) and the first 5 affected files (`and N more…`). Off-screen selected cards are optimistically updated and stay in sync when scrolled into view.
